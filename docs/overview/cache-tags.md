# Cache Tags

Cache tags make cache invalidation easier, because they directly link cached items to a data source.

## Basics

A cache tag is a unique identifier of an entity, like an article, an image or a
configuration. A few examples of what a cache tag might look like:

- `article:235`
- `image:313`
- `config:site:page_title`
- `image_style:hero_large_retina`

Typically, cache tags are generated by a backend (e.g. Drupal, Laravel,
Symfony) and are provided to the frontend via a HTTP header.

The same backend will also trigger invalidations. For example when editing the
article with ID 235, it will perform the POST request to purge the article:235
tag in nuxt-multi-cache. Or when the page title configuration is edited, it
will purge the config:site:page_title tag.

## Use without a backend

The backend part is optional. You can handle cache tags and invalidation also
completely yourself.

### Example: Caching search result pages

You could cache ElasticSearch search result pages using a single tag:
search_page. Now whenever you reindex your data, you afterwards issue a purge
request for that tag via cURL.
