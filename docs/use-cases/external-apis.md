# External APIs

External APIs can be unpredictable to work with. They might be unreliable or
just slow. By using the [data cache](/features/data-cache) you can cache the
responses indefinitely or for a fixed amount of time and depending on your case
greatly improve response times of your app.

Or maybe you have rate limits or pay by request on the API. If the data doesn't
change often then this feature is for you.
